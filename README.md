# workout-tracker
This Python program uses the Nutritionix API to ask the user what kind of exercise they performed and for what duration. The Nutritionix API then calculates the number of calories burned based on the user's response and then uses the Sheety API to create a new data entry in a Google Sheets spreadsheet that logs the user's exercise.
